# Introduction

There are three ways to participate:
 - If your organization is a W3C Member, ask your AC Rep to join
 - If your organization is not a W3C Member, you can evaluate to join
 - If you would like to participate as an individual, this group is open to Invited Experts

# Invite expert invitations

## Expectations

We generally welcome anyone interested in working on and improving security on the Web. However, we expect Security Interest Group participants to contribute, which can take the form of participating in privacy reviews, scribing calls, participating in discussions, among other things. Inactive or non-contributing invited experts may not be renewed.
